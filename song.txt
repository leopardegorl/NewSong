Come here, baby

You know you drive me up a wall
The way you make good
For all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're making up more than we're making love
And it always seems you got something on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways, you hear me

Say you're leaving on a seven thirty train
And that you're heading out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been giving me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feeling bad looks good, yeah
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on then you're gone, yeah, you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey, I feel like the color blue

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough
And trying to tell me that it's time to go, yeah
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show, yeah
That kinda loving makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah
That kinda loving, yeah
Now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same
